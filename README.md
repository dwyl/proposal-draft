# Proposal (*draft*)

![messaging-ios-apps](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10747146/d153f7ae-7c49-11e5-8899-72ae80fb0da6.png)

## Why?

**Team communication** ***pain*** is a ***real problem*** many people face.   
We want to help solve it with a *light-weight*, *low-latency* & *scalable* solution.

Our team has experience building real-time, fault-tolerant & distributed systems
and understand *Risk* in Financial Services so we can meet any/all
compliance requirements for data security, privacy and system integrity for both internal & external audit.

## What?

The fastest way for brokers to securely share time-sensitive pricing data with clients.

### Highlights

+ Mobile-first solution
+ Industry-leading Technology
+ Ultra-low Latency
+ End-to-End Encryption
+ Built-in Analytics/Tracking

### Detail

+ Display price spread, volume and timeframe for each commodity.
+ Allow broker to select a row or multiple rows of data to be shared.
+ When a row is selected automatically copy the pre-formatted data
to clip-board (*excluding*) supplier info so that it can be shared
with clients.
+ Role-based Access Controls prevent un-authorised people from viewing
sensitive data while still letting them see what is relevant to them.
+ Broker can define what data gets shared in settings definitions
+  ... *Additional requirements to be defined in future iterations*.


## Who?

### The Client

As one of the most successful commodities brokers in London,
**Company XYZ** has developed a reputation for providing the
best prices to their clients in a time-sensitive marketplace.
The communication system used requires a refresh to keep up
with the demands of clients based in several geographic regions.

### *Implementation* Team

We are a *community* of people passionate about using technology to solve real problems.   
In addition to the ***London-based team***
we have people contributing *remotely* to our project(s) from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Estonia, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa & USA
(*the list grows daily*).

Each project we undertake is staffed by a small team of people
based in the same location as the client to ensure clear communication and rapid iteration. We augment this team with remote expertise as required e.g. to test our output or provide over-night code-review (*while A-Team sleeps*).

> We expect to have a **team of 5 people** (*London-based*) working on this project:
+ ***System Architect*** - defines the overall project
+ ***Scrum Master/Project Manager*** - tracks team progress, liaises with client on requirements and ensures features are *tested* when delivered.
+ ***User Interface Designer*** - ensures minimal responsive design to achieve the desired goal (*avoids complex/complicated UI*) 
+ ***Developers*** - build the bulk of features as specified
in *close collaboration* with the client/end-users

## *How*?

Using industry-standard (*fast*) messaging processing between data-centers.

### How Long Will it Take to Build an *Initial Version*?

We estimate that it will take 4 weeks to build a Minimum Useable Product.
#### Week 1
+ Understanding & ***Documenting*** the ***Existing Systems*** being used
+ ***Clarifying Requirements*** (*ensuring we are solving the underlying problem not just treating a symptom*)
+ ***Defining Acceptance Criteria*** (*what defines success for the project*?)
+ Creating the Development Environment


## *When*?

As soon as the team can be assembled.
