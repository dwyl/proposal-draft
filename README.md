# Proposal (*draft*)

## Why?

We are passionate about using technology to solve real problems.
Improving communication in teams is a *real problem* many people face.

We have experience building real-time fault-tolerant distributed systems
and have worked in Risk in Financial Services so are aware of
compliance requirements.

## What?

A way of allowing brokers to share pricing details with clients in real-time.

## Who?

We are a *community* of people. In addition to the London-based team
we have people contributing remotely to our project(s) from New Zealand, Argentina, South Africa, Brazil and Canada.
